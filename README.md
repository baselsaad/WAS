## Project Overview

The game was created within a collaborative, interdisciplinary course offered across HTW, HBKsaar, and UdS universities. Students from Practical Informatics, Media Informatics, Media Culture Studies, and Media Art & Design joined forces to develop a playable game prototype. The project placed a strong emphasis on honing diverse skills such as programming, storytelling, and audiovisual representation. 
It is a first-person game where you have to solve puzzles and find story papers and newspapers.
